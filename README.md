# Google-Capstone-Project
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
